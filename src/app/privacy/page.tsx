          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            For the purposes of applicable data protection laws, CloudKarya, Inc. is the
            “controller” (or equivalent term) for personal information processed through this
            website.
          </p>

          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Information you provide:</strong> If you contact us or submit a form, we may
              collect the information you provide (for example, your name, email address, company,
              and message).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Usage and device information:</strong> We may collect information about how
              the site is used (for example, pages viewed, page referrers, approximate location,
              device/browser information, and interactions) through cookies or similar
              technologies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Account and sign-in information:</strong> If you sign in, we receive limited
              information from the identity provider you choose (for example, Google or LinkedIn).
              This may include your name, email address, profile image, and a provider identifier,
              depending on what the provider shares and what you approve.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tutorials and learning activity:</strong> When you use Tutorials or other
              interactive features, we may collect information about the actions you take (for
              example, tutorial starts/completions, session creation, and related operational
              telemetry needed to provide the feature).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Provide and operate the site:</strong> deliver pages, route requests, prevent
              abuse, and maintain availability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Authenticate users:</strong> enable sign-in and access to gated areas like
              Tutorials.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improve content and product experience:</strong> understand what content is
              useful (for example, blogs and case studies) and what experiences work well.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Communicate with you:</strong> respond to inquiries, provide requested

            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
          <p>
            If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, we rely on one or
            more of the following legal bases to process personal information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Consent</strong> (for example, for certain analytics cookies where required).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Contract</strong> (to provide features you request, such as authenticated
              Tutorials).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> (to operate, secure, and improve the website),
              balanced against your rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal obligations</strong> (where we must comply with law).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Cookies and Analytics</h2>
          <p>
            We use cookies and similar technologies for essential site functionality, security, and
            analytics. Analytics helps us understand usage patterns (for example, which pages are
            read and how content performs).
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use Google Analytics (GA4) or similar tools that set cookies and collect
            information such as pages viewed, device/browser type, and approximate location derived
            from IP address. You can manage cookies via your browser settings and, where applicable,
            through any cookie controls we provide.
          </p>
          <p>
            UK and EU rules may treat certain analytics cookies as “non-essential”. Where required
            by applicable law (including the UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations
            (PECR) and EU ePrivacy rules), we will seek consent before placing non-essential cookies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google also provides an opt-out browser add-on for Google Analytics. You can learn more
            in Google’s documentation.
          </p>

          <h2>Authentication (Google / LinkedIn)</h2>
          <p>
            If you choose to sign in using Google or LinkedIn, authentication is handled through
            those providers. We use the information they provide to create and maintain your
            session, help prevent abuse, and enable gated features. Your use of those providers is
            also governed by their privacy policies.
          </p>

          <h2>Sharing</h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Service providers</strong> that help us operate the site and deliver services
              (for example, hosting, analytics, authentication, error monitoring).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal and safety</strong> recipients when required by law or to protect rights,
              safety, and security.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>International Transfers</h2>
          <p>
            We may process and store information in countries other than where you live (including
            the United States) through our service providers. Where required, we use appropriate
            safeguards for cross-border transfers, such as the European Commission’s Standard
            Contractual Clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) or UK
            Addendum.
          </p>

          <h2>Your Rights (EEA/UK)</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have rights to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Request access to personal information we hold about you.</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate information.</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your information.</li>
            <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
            <li>Request portability of your information.</li>
            <li>Withdraw consent at any time (where processing is based on consent).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. In
            the UK, this is the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).
          </p>

          <h2>Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain information only as long as needed for the purposes described above, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
          </p>

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to
            protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
          </p>

          <h2>Children</h2>
          <p>
            This website is not directed to children. If you believe a child has provided us with
            personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on
